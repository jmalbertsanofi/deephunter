Description
***********
The timeline shows the distribution of threat hunting analytics available in DeepHunter on a timeline graph, and visually highlights possible correlations between events.

The timeline module contains a lot of useful information for threat hunters and incident responders:

- **List of matching threat hunting analytics**: by simply looking at the list of threat hunting analytics, the threat hunter can estimate risks and build hypothesis. 
- **Distribution over time**: each blue "box" represents events that match the threat hunting analytic on the header row. Having a visual representation of this distribution is useful to build hypothesis (possible correlation of events).
- **Storyline highlights**: mouse over a "box" to display the storylineID (SentinelOne EDR information) associated to the events matching the threat hunting analytic.
- **Threats**: confirmed threats (detected by SentinelOne) are shown on a dedicated line. The storylineID is also gathered for threats.
- **Applications**: The distribution of applications installed is also shown on a dedicated line. It can be used to make hypothesis (e.g., guess that some events may be generated by an application installed the same day).
- **Host/User**: Machine name, OS, and site name + additional information gathered from the Active Directory, from the machine username (user, job title, business unit, location).
- **Active Directory**: list of Active Directory groups the user belongs to (information gathered from SentinelOne)
- **App Inventory**: List of installed applications, versions, and installation date (information gathered from SentinelOne)

How to use the timeline?
************************

- **Search**: Enter a endpoint name in the search field and press ENTER.
- **Compact view**: by default, the view shows as many boxes as necessary, for each day. It may happen that several threats are detected on a given day, or several applications are installed the same day. To have a more compact and readable timeline, click on "compact view", to limit the timeline to a maximum of 1 box/day.
- **Send to Netview**: sends the machine name to the `netview <usage_netview.html>`_ module.
- **Zoom in/out + drag timeline**: scroll on your mouse to zoom in/out. Click on the timeline and drag it to the left or right to move over time.
- **Simple click**: : Click on a box to highlight all boxes (event from different analytics with the same storylineID).
- **Double click**: Sends the query to SentinelOne PowerQuery module, for the clicked date.
